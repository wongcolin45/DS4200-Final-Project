      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <h4>Introduction to Project</h4>
      <p>Income inequality is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Our project is driven by a passion for uncovering the intricate relationships between certain variables such as race and gender and how they influence income distribution. By transforming raw data into engaging visual narratives, we aim to reveal hidden patterns and disparities that traditional analyses might overlook. Hopefully this project can inform everyone about the problem of income disparity and spark critical conversations on how informed policy can lead to more equitable opportunities.</p>
      <h4>Introduction to Data</h4>
      <p>The dataset used consists of individual-level demographic and employment-related information commonly found in income classification tasks such as the UCI Adult dataset. It contains 45222 records (rows), with each record representing a person. There are 15 attributes (columns) in total, including features such as age, workclass, fnlwgt (final weight), education, educational-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, gender, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country, and income. The final attribute, income, is the target variable and indicates whether a person's income is more than $50K or not. These attributes span categorical and numerical data types and provide a wide view of socioeconomic and occupational factors.</p>
      <p>We can split the features into different groups.  The first would be demographics such as age, race, gender, and country. Then we have an education feature of the highest level of education received.  Then we have economic features such as the person's capital gains, losses, income bracket, and the hours worked.  Finally there have various family features such as their marriage stage and their occupation.</p>
