      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>Our visualizations reveal that income inequality is influenced by a variety of factors including education, gender, race, and work hours. The data demonstrate that higher levels of education are generally associated with higher income, yet significant disparities exist across different demographic groups. We have learned that while certain trends, such as the positive correlation between education and earnings, are evident, the varied patterns in capital gains and work hours highlight the multifaceted nature of economic inequality. Future work could benefit from incorporating more granular datasets, exploring additional socioeconomic variables, and developing more interactive dashboards to offer deeper, dynamic insights into these trends. These enhancements will not only refine our understanding but also help create policies aimed at reducing inequality and promoting more equitable economic opportunities.</p>
