This interactive scatter plot highlights how capital gains vary by age and enables users to zoom in on different demographic slices using the education and income filters. At a glance, the bulk of observations cluster around lower capital gains, reflecting that most individuals in the dataset have minimal to no additional capital income. Outliers with very high capital gains can be easily spotted, illustrating potential wealth disparities within the population. By filtering on specific education levels or income brackets, patterns or clusters can emerge—such as whether higher levels of education correspond to greater capital gains—providing a more nuanced understanding of how these attributes intersect with wealth accumulation.  The visualization is designed for straightforward exploration of how age correlates with capital gain, while still allowing flexibility to examine subgroups. A scatter plot was chosen for its ability to display individual data points and outliers clearly, emphasizing the overall spread. Two dropdown menus—Education and Income—are implemented as interactive parameters, letting viewers isolate particular educational backgrounds or income levels on demand. Large circle markers, combined with tooltips, ensure essential information like age, capital gain, education, and income is readily visible when hovering over any point. This approach balances clarity with interactivity: it conveys big-picture distribution patterns and simultaneously supports a deeper dive into demographic nuances.
